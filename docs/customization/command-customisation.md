This Feature is from discord and everybot have it but you can not use it in evry bot like in DisBot.

You can set permissions to roles and members. If an Command need admin you can set it to Manage Server or only for one member.

Here are a Tutorial.

### Example from a Edited Command

- `@everyone` can not use the Command
- The `@Team` Role can use the Command in the #chat Channel

### Important

- Not all systems work and maybe you should use commands in channels where you are "alone", because in the following code I may not have if questions to check if the member has the permissions.
- And some system can not be used with this because I have when checks for permissions
