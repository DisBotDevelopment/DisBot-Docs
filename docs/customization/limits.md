# Limits

DisBot is designed to be a powerful and flexible Discord bot, but there are some limitations to keep in mind when using it. These limitations are in place to ensure the bot runs smoothly and efficiently, and to prevent abuse or misuse of its features.

## Commands

DisBot has a command Cooldown system in place to prevent spam and abuse. This means that there are limits on how often you can use certain commands. The cooldown times vary depending on the command and its intended use.

## API's and Integrations

DisBot used Third Party API's and Integrations to provide its features. These API's may have their own limitations, such as rate limits or usage quotas. DisBot will do its best to work within these limitations, but there may be times when certain features are temporarily unavailable due to API restrictions.

## More

No more limits are currently in place, but this may change in the future as DisBot continues to evolve and grow. If you have any questions or concerns about the limitations of DisBot, please feel free to reach out to the support team for assistance.
