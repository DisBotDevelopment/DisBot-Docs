Please selcet your Reaction type but the setup is the same for both.
Only the Display is different. For buttons is the reaction a button and for selectmenus is the reaction a selectmenu...

If the message you use in the Setup is from DisBot or you Customer then you can use Buttons and Selectmenus.
If you get an interaction error but the reaction is on the message then everything is fine. But Report it to us.
